				<strong>Hi there, </strong>I'm Jessica. A Upcoming Frontend Developer
				currently studying at Technigo Coding Bootcamp, expecting to graduate in
				January 2023 ðŸŽ‰. I have almost 5 years experience in Tech Talent
				Acquisition operations in major Tech companies. Working with developers
				on daily basis in some way inspired me to be a developer myself. Not
				only because of my passion and curiosity for coding, but also the desire
				to explore the unknown, continuous learning and feeling supported by the
				tech community.
