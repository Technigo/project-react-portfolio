				<strong>Hi there, </strong>I'm Jessica. A Upcoming Frontend Developer
				just finished studying at Technigo Coding Bootcamp 🎉. I have almost 6
				years experience in Tech Talent Acquisition operations in major Tech
				companies. Working with developers on daily basis in some way inspired
				me to be a developer myself. Not only because of my passion and
				curiosity for coding, but also the desire to explore the unknown,
				continuous learning and feeling supported by the tech community.
