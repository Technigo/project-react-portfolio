# React Portfolio
Remake portfolio with react styled components

## The problem
I did som tweaks to the design and made mobile, tablet and desktop versions in Figma. Deciding every component that I needed and tried to structure up what styles was global and which needed their own component files. 

I would finnish the styling and add the SoMe links if I had more time.

## View it live
Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
