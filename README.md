# React Portfolio
Remake portfolio with react styled components

## The problem
I did som tweaks to the design and made mobile, tablet and desktop versions in Figma. Deciding every component that I needed and tried to structure up what styles was global and which needed their own component files. 

I would finnish the styling and add the SoMe links if I had more time.
