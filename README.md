# React Portfolio
This project was written in React together with styled components.
The challenge was to take a finished HTML/CSS page (https://github.com/joeohm/project-portfolio) and convert it into a React app with split components, and also using styled components instead of a globl style sheet.  
I decided to break the styled components up in one globally shared styled components (Styled.js) which can be reused, and then each React component has its own styled components as well.
