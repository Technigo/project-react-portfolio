# React Portfolio
I have rebuilt my portfolio with React and used styled components to style it.

## The problem
I started with thinking about the structure of my portfolio and what components I could re-use and therefore make global. Then I started with building one section of the page at the time, and continiously filling up the global styled components, and move even more styled components to be global.

I will continue with this portfolio and the plan is to make the images look better, add a loader to "other projects" part (only show a couple of them and give the user an opportunity to load more), make the icons elements global and re-use instead of adding them in several places, try different colorings. I also need to add proper text and every section including the data.json.
