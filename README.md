# React Portfolio
Replace this readme with your own information about your project.

Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.

## The problem
Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

Left to do: 
- update description about projects
- create an overlay on project pictures
- add tags to projects
- link to github repo on projects
- make skills unto lists
- show less big projects in mobile view

## View it live
Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
