# React Portfolio

Portfolio made in React with Styled Components.

## The problem

I divided each section of the previous HTML/CSS version of the portfolio into their own component. As for the Styled Components I chose to make some things their own styled component, some grids and containers etc. For the sections with more one-off styled elements (like the header for example) I decided to put the styling in the same file as the component for that section. 

When I had been working on the portfolio for a while I thought I had too many styled components, so I decided to put some of them in the same file, instead of keeping them separated in their own files. Since I wanted to really get familiar with styled components I decided to remove the index.css file completely and used a Global styled component for more general styling.
