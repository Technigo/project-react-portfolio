# React Portfolio
This project was a conversion of my previously built portfolio page (built on plain HMTL and CSS) to one built with React and utilising the GitHub API. 

## The problem
In addition to using React and the API, style-components was used instead of vanilla css. With more time I will add a personalised favicon as well as access the API with a token in order to have unlimited daily API calls.
